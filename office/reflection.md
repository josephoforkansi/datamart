## BASIC OPERATIONS CHARACTERISTICS

*Please answer all below questions pertaining to the basic premises of the operations being briefed.*

### To your understanding, what was the goal of this week's work?

From my understanding i believe the goal of this week's work is to function as a team collecting and entering data from various neighborhoods. Organizing collected data and doing basic data analysis with collected data.

## What was one non-programmatic difficulty you encountered with your data? Describe it below.

I struggled with communication because somedays we had missing team members. To find the data mode i needed others to merge their codes.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROCESS

### Describe the reasoning behind the `scrum` process. How can it be helpful when working in a team?

I believe the reasoning behind the 'scrum' process is to help the team work together. It can be helpful by making complex projects more simple and flexible when working in a team.

### Retrospective: describe improvements you would like to make during the next team-based project

Not sure yet.

## ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL APPLICATION

*Please answer all below questions pertaining to a higher-level analysis of the operations being briefed and their related ideas.*

### Describe the difference between `while` and `for` loops. In what situations would you need one over the other?

'for' loop is used whenever we know the number of iterations. 'while' loop is used whenever we don't know the number of iterations but we only know the stopping condition.  

### Were lists necessary for completing this week's tasks? Could you have completed the assignment without them?

Yes. It definitely made this week's tasks more flexible. I think yes. But it is important we know how to use them, to make code look more understandable and to avoid making the situation more complex.

## DATA QUESTIONNAIRE

*Please answer all below questions pertaining to an evaluation of the operations being briefed.*

### What do you think the Mayor is going to do with all of this data?

First, I think the mayor is going to evaluate all this data. Also I think the major will use this as a technical standpoint for other projects.

### Does it matter?

Yes, I think it matters the mayor evaluate this. Because there could be errors we might not see as new programmers. But we learn from our mistakes and feedback.
